Frontend Development ✨

As a frontend developer, I focused on building a user-friendly and responsive interface for the club management website. I utilized HTML and JavaScript to create a structured and maintainable codebase, and CSS to style the application with a consistent and modern look.

Backend Development 🚧

Due to time constraints, I was unable to complete the backend development for this project. However, I have planned the backend architecture and created a basic database schema. The backend will be implemented using Node.js and MYSQL

NOTE 💬
 I registered for the frontend role on the registration form on google form and i didn't thing i was doing a backend project. but the project includes backend as well. I am currently pursuing knowledge in frontend development and i didn't have enough time to study backend development. i hope this is taken into consideration when grading
